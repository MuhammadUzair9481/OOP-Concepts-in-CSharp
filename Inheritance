# Inheritance in C#

## Definition
Inheritance is an Object-Oriented Programming concept in which one class (child or derived class) acquires the properties and methods of another class (parent or base class).

## Why Inheritance is Used
- To reuse existing code
- To reduce code duplication
- To improve code organization
- To support extensibility

## Key Terms
- **Base Class (Parent):** The class whose properties are inherited
- **Derived Class (Child):** The class that inherits from another class
- **`:` Operator:** Used to inherit a class in C#

## Syntax
```csharp
class Parent
{
    public void Show()
    {
        Console.WriteLine("This is Parent class");
    }
}

class Child : Parent
{
}
