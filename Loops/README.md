 # Loops in OOP (C#)

## Definition

A **loop** is a control structure used to **execute a block of code repeatedly** until a given condition is met. In **Object-Oriented Programming**, loops are commonly used inside classes and methods to handle repetitive tasks.

---

## Why Loops are Used

* To repeat code efficiently
* To work with arrays and objects
* To reduce code duplication
* To automate repetitive operations

---

## Types of Loops in OOP (C#)

* **for loop** – used when the number of iterations is known
* **while loop** – used when the condition is checked before execution
* **do-while loop** – executes at least once before checking condition
* **foreach loop** – used to iterate through arrays and collections

---

## Key Terms

* **Initialization**: Starting point of loop
* **Condition**: Controls loop execution
* **Iteration**: One complete loop cycle

## Syntax of Loops (C#)

### For Loop

```csharp
for (int i = 0; i < 5; i++)
{
    // loop body
}
```

### While Loop

```csharp
while (condition)
{
    // loop body
}
```

### Do-While Loop

```csharp
do
{
    // loop body
}
while (condition);
```

### Foreach Loop

```csharp
foreach (var item in collection)
{
    // loop body
}
```



## Important Points

* Loops must have a valid condition
* Infinite loops should be avoided
* Loops are often used with arrays

---

## Conclusion

Loops are a **fundamental concept in OOP** that help execute repetitive tasks efficiently and make programs shorter, cleaner, and more organized.
